# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis-Analysis
Our objective was the classification of Cancer Classes based upon the Gene, Variation &amp; Text and the problem statement was to classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. Various ML model were applied and the results were compared. 

Business constraints: 1.errors can be costly 2.interpretability is very important 3.No low latency is required

Data Overview: 1.training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class) 2.training_text (ID, Text)

Performance matrix: 1.multi class log-loss 2.confusion matrix

Results of different applied models can be noticed in each corresponding file.

NB: This project was done as a part of assignment for machine Learning course taken at appliedaicourse.com/
